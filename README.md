# OctoPrint-Cancelobject

This plugin allows the user to interactively cancel objects in gcode based on comment tags added by the slicer.
Currently, the only working model is using Simplify3D and including a separate process for each object (or group of
objects) that the user may want to cancel.
## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

**TODO:** Describe how to install your plugin, if more needs to be done than just installing it via pip or through
the plugin manager.

## Configuration

This is the initial testing version. No settings are active yet and there has been not attempt to make things look nice.
